Diagrams and visual languages are a great thing,
but getting the layout just right for them to be easily understandable
can be tedious and time-consuming.
The Eclipse Layout Kernel provides a number of layout algorithms
as well as an Eclipse-based infrastructure to connect them
to editors and viewers.
The layout algorithms are plain Java
and can thus also be used outside of Eclipse.
