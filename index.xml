      <description>Release log Update site Zipped update site (for offline use) Maven Repository (for meta data language compiler) DEtails A major overhaul of ELK&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. This is an API breaking release. The following are probably the biggest issues we tackled:
Refactored the central graph data structure. This is a biggie: we made the whole graph data structure easier to understand and easier to use, but of course broke compatibility with old diagram layout connectors in the process.</description>

      <guid>https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/usingeclipselayout/advancedconfiguration.html</guid>
      <description>What we have learned so far about how automatic layout in Eclipse works was comparatively straightforward: the diagram layout engine looks for a diagram layout connector to get its hands at a configured ElkGraph, invokes the recursive graph layout engine, and asks the diagram layout connector to apply the results back to the original diagram. As you will have guessed, things can become quite a bit more complex than that.</description>

      <guid>https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/algorithmdevelopers/algorithmdebugging.html</guid>
      <description>The Eclipse Layout Kernel provides debugging support through its debugging infrastructure, which consists of three layers:

      <description>While the layout algorithms implemented in ELK already cover a wide range of layout styles, your particular application may have more specific requirements. In these cases, it may become necessary to implement your own layout algorithm, which is what this part of the documentation is all about.
Implementing your own layout algorithm basically consists of the following steps:
Install the Eclipse Layout Kernel SDK into your Eclipse development environment. Create and configure a new Eclipse plug-in project.</description>

      <description>Once everything is set up, it is time to actually implement your algorithm. The problem your layout algorithm has to solve can be summarized as follows: given an input graph (possibly with existing coordinates), compute coordinates for all graph elements and routings for all edges (subject to layout properties the graph is annotated with) and annotate the layout graph accordingly. Note that the input graph defines the layout problem, but also carries the resulting coordinate assignment after your algorithm has executed.</description>

      <description>Since .melk files result in code being generated, you may not want to check that code into your repository. Instead, the code should probably be generated as part of your automatic build. Indeed, the ELK metadata language compiler is available through a Maven repository. You can find the repository URLs in our Downloads section. Note that we provide a separate repository for nightly builds and for each release.
To use the compiler, add the following to your pom.</description>

      <description>ELK is built using Apache Maven in conjunction with Tycho to tell Maven how to build Eclipse projects. There are two parts that can be built: the Eclipse Layout Kernel itself, and the metadata compiler used by the main ELK build. The remainder of this page assumes that you have opened a shell in the build/ directory inside your clone of the ELK repository.
Building ELK Execute Maven using the following command line (note that the command line is split in order to improve readability):</description>

      <description>In our our basic introduction to automatic layout in Eclipse, we have seen how the diagram layout engine needs someone to extract a proper ElkGraph from whatever layout is invoked on. This is what you, as a tool developer, have to supply. While there are already implementations for different graph editing frameworks to build upon, this page describes how doing so from scratch works.
To connect to ELK, there are two things you will have to do:</description>

      <description>When talking about the layout of a graph, we have to agree on how coordinates of graph elements are to be stored and interpreted. For the ELK graph, this is how it works:
The coordinates of most elements are relative to their parent element. There are a few exceptions:
Edge labels are relative to the coordinate system their edge is relative to. Source points, bend points, and target points of edges are relative to the edge&amp;rsquo;s containing node.</description>

      <description>As you have learned, the basic connection between a diagram editor and the Eclipse Layout Kernel is established through an ILayoutSetup implementation registered with an extension point. What an ILayoutSetup basically does is to provide a Google Guice dependency injector that is then used to instantiate all the classes that play a part in making layout happen in the Eclipse layer.
If you have not used dependency injection yet: ELK will ask the injector to retrieve an implementation of a particular type, and the injector knows which implementation to retrieve.</description>

Category: Layered The layer-based method was introduced by Sugiyama, Tagawa and Toda in 1981. It emphasizes the direction of edges by pointing as many edges as possible into the same direction. The nodes are arranged in layers, which are sometimes called &amp;ldquo;hierarchies&amp;rdquo;, and then reordered such that the number of edge crossings is minimized.</description>

      <description>By Miro Spönemann, November 17, 2022
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the availability of a new Maven module / Eclipse plug-in org.eclipse.elk.alg.libavoid that offers orthogonal edge routing with fixed nodes. Credits for this work go to Ulf Rüegg, a former employee of the Real-Time and Embedded Systems group, where most of the development on ELK is happening. My contribution is merely to revive this code and include it in the building and publishing process of the ELK project.</description>

      <description>Property Value Identifier: org.eclipse.elk.layered Meta Data Provider: options.LayeredMetaDataProvider Description Layer-based algorithm provided by the Eclipse Layout Kernel. Arranges as many edges as possible into one direction by placing nodes into subsequent layers. This implementation supports different routing styles (straight, orthogonal, splines); if orthogonal routing is selected, arbitrary port constraints are respected, thus enabling the layout of block diagrams such as actor-oriented models or circuit schematics. Furthermore, full layout of compound graphs with cross-hierarchy edges is supported when the respective option is activated on the top level.</description>

      <description>As described in other parts of the documentation, the Eclipse Layout Kernel relies on metadata about all available layout algorithms and the layout options they support. Supplying metadata for your layout algorithm is done by writing an ELK Metadata File in our textual metadata language. The file is used by the ELK SDK to generate the following Java classes:
An ILayoutMetaDataProvider that contains IProperty objects for each layout option you declare, along with a method that registers these options and layout algorithm categories with the LayoutMetaDataService.</description>

      <description>Property Value Identifier: org.eclipse.elk.stress Meta Data Provider: options.StressMetaDataProvider Description Minimizes the stress within a layout using stress majorization. Stress exists if the euclidean distance between a pair of nodes doesn&amp;rsquo;t match their graph theoretic distance, that is, the shortest path between the two nodes. The method allows to specify individual edge lengths.
Category: Force Layout algorithms that follow physical analogies by simulating a system of attractive and repulsive forces. The first successful method of this kind was proposed by Eades in 1984.</description>

      <guid>https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/graphdatastructure/elktextformat.html</guid>
      <description>The ELK text format has five basic elements: nodes, ports, labels, edges and edge sections. Details about each element can be found below. Note that the ELK text format uses default node sizes if they are not specified to make writing elkt files more convenient. This is different from the JSON format, where no such defaults are assumed.
Nodes, Ports, Labels, Edges, and Edge Sections Nodes and ports must have an id that uniquely identifies them.</description>

      <description>Setting up an Eclipse to work on the Eclipse Layout Kernel is comparatively easy when using the Oomph Installer. Follow this step-by-step guide for great glory.
Start the installer. This is what it will look like, more or less:
Click on the Hamburger menu (the three stripes at the top right). A menu with additional options will magically appear:
Click the Advanced Mode button (we&amp;rsquo;re programmers, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with the simple stuff).</description>

Details about each element can be found below, with some sections describing features common to multiple elements. Note that in the JSON code, mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk.
Nodes, Ports, Labels, Edges, and Edge Sections All elements, except labels, must have an id that uniquely identifies them. Labels are usually not referred to from other parts of the graph, which is why the id is optional.</description>

The layered algorithm or Sugiyama algorithm is in its implementation in ELK divided into five phases with intermediate processing slots: Cycle Breaking, Layer Assignment, Crossing Minimization, Node Placement, and Edge Routing.
Using the occasion of the upcoming ELK 0.11.0 release, I want to shed more light on the ELK Layered algorithm and how to find the correct layout phase to configure.
In the following, I will assume that the layout direction is left-to-right, or speaking in ELK layout options elk.</description>

Since it is often desired to constrain the layout in a specific way to achieve a desired layout or to increase layout stability, this post should summarize all current (ELK 0.8.1) and future (planned for 0.9.0) ways to do that. The following will focus primarily on constraining the node order. If you wish to constrain the ports have a look at the portConstraints property and this example.</description>

The coming update (ELK 0.9.2) introduces a new feature to control the positioning of nodes in a layer for further compaction. Layer Unzipping can split up the nodes of a single layer into multiple layers. This reduces the total height and can be helpful in certain situations.
The update introduces three new properties:
org.eclipse.elk.layerUnzipping.strategy org.eclipse.elk.layerUnzipping.layerSplit org.eclipse.elk.layerUnizpping.resetOnLongEdges This elklive example demonstrates the properties and the exact behaviour of the properties is explained in the sections below.</description>

      <description>Layout options are key-value pairs that configure the behavior of automatic layout algorithms. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at all of the involved classes first before we concentrate on how to actually use them in practice.
Involved Classes Layout options are represented by annotating objects with properties. There are two main types we need to cover: the properties themselves, and the objects we can configure through properties.
Properties The most important type when it comes to properties is the IProperty interface.</description>

      <description>If UI components are installed, ELK contributes the Layout View to the workbench:
The layout view is a kind of properties view specialized for setting layout properties. It listens to selection changes and, if it recognizes that something is an element of a graph ELK could layout, allows users to customize the layout options used to do so.
It is a fair question whether users should be given access to this view or not.</description>

      <description>By Sören Domrös, August 22, 2025
I always seem to forget how to properly add node labels in ELK such that it adjusts its size based on them. Therefore, this little guide should solve your problems with node labels and help me remember all the required options and configurations.
The full example model I will show in the following, can be found here.
My error in properly letting a parent node consider the size of a node label is that just setting nodeSize.</description>

      <guid>https://www.eclipse.org/elk/blog/posts/2022/22-08-31-rectpacking.html</guid>
      <description>By Sören Domrös, August 31, 2022, updated January 4, 2024
The rectpacking algorithm was introduced to solved common problems with the box algorithm, which cannot stack boxes in a row. The idea is to form stacks with subrows inside rows, while the size of a row is always dominated by a highest rectangle to provide a visual anchor point to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; the rows from left to right.
Since it was a common use case of the box algorithm to add a priority to order the rectangles rectpacking uses the model order (which corresponds to the input order of the rectangles) as a criterion.</description>

      <description>Space-able elements As far as the ELK core is concerned, the following elements can have spacing:
Nodes Ports Labels Edges Comments Connected components The first three can be thought of as boxes with some space to be left around them. Edges are not boxes, and connected components may be more complex than simple boxes.
ELK Layered adds the concept of layers, which leads to a few additional spacing values as described later.</description>

      <description>Often enough, algorithms can be divided into a number of layout phases which, executed as a pipeline, compute a layout. If your algorithm falls into this category, read on; ELK provides things you might want to use.
Layout Phases and Layout Processors Structuring the algorithm into phases has several advantages. First, it effectively divides the big layout problem into simpler sub problems. Second, it allows the algorithm to be more flexible.</description>

      <description>This section of the documentation is meant for tool developers who simply want to add automatic layout capabilities to their tool. Despite of its name, the Eclipse Layout Kernel is not limited to Eclipse-based applications, but can also be used in pure Java applications and even in JavaScript applications (although this is not yet available in ELK itself).
Three Layers of Layout Goodness At its basic, ELK is structured in three layers, each adding more convenience functionality to lower layers:</description>

      <description>By Maximilian Kasperowski, June 9, 2023
The coming update (ELK 0.9.0) introduces a new approach to layout hierarchical graphs. Instead of increasing the size of parent nodes to fit their content we apply scaling to the content to make it fit the parent. In this post I will go over the new properties provided to achieve this and what kinds of output can be produced using top-down layout.
Scaling In addition to the existing data assigned to graph elements during layout such as positions, nodes can now also have the additional property org.</description>

      <description>Layout algorithms are complex pieces of software and, thus, should probably be tested. Besides the usual plain JUnit tests, ELK provides a graph algorithm unit test framework based on JUnit 4. Tests written with that framework basically do three things:
Load one or more graphs.
Optionally provide a number of graph configurations. If a test class doesn&amp;rsquo;t specify configurations, a default configuration will be activated.
Run one ore more tests on each graph.</description>

      <description>All layout algorithms implemented in the Eclipse Layout Kernel can be called directly. To do so, you must have an instance of our ElkGraph data structure that can be fed to the layout algorithm, which will then compute a layout for the graph&amp;rsquo;s elements.
Warning: This is very low-level stuff. If you want to stay in the pure-Java domain (as opposed to building an Eclipse-based application), you will probably want to use the next layer of abstraction.</description>

      <description>Compared to the two more basic variants, using the Eclipse Layout Kernel within Eclipse introduces the largest amount of general magic to the process. This page explains the basics of how the layout kernel performs automatic layouts. Based on these information, sub-pages then describe how to integrate your tool with the layout kernel by filling in the details the overview decided to best leave out.
How Layout Works in Eclipse Layout in Eclipse revolves around the DiagramLayoutEngine, which in turn builds upon the IGraphLayoutEngine interface that layout in pure Java revolves around.</description>

      <description>While layout algorithms can be called directly, it is usually a better idea not to do so except in the simplest of cases. There are several reasons for that:
When calling a layout algorithm directly, your code is hardwired to that implementation and looses a bit of flexibility.
Most importantly, as graphs get more complex there are more and more details to be aware of when executing layout. This is especially true for compound graphs: graphs with nodes that contain further graphs themselves.</description>

      <description>Property Value Type: advanced Identifier: org.eclipse.elk.topdown.sizeCategoriesHierarchicalNodeWeight Meta Data Provider: core.options.CoreOptions Value Type: int Default Value: 4 (as defined in org.eclipse.elk) Lower Bound: 1 Applies To: parents Dependencies: org.eclipse.elk.topdown.sizeCategories Containing Group: topdown Description When determining the graph size for the size categorisation, this value determines how many times a node containing children is weighted more than a simple node. For example setting this value to four would result in a graph containing a simple node and a hierarchical node to be counted as having a size of five.</description>
